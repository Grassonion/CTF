Ingridients needed:
	* One textfile of characters

Delicious end result:
	* A 44 character long flag


Cooking instructions:
	1. Gather all the rows
	2. Half of the rows can be discarded. The second half in fact.
	3. While you are at it - you can cut every row in half. Again keep the first half.
	4. Delete every other row - Start with the very first one.
	5. For every fourth row starting at row one you should swap a character with row zero.
	6. Keep count of those rows - start counting at zero and do not count any longer than the length of the flag.
	7. The character to swap between the two rows are at the position that you currently have counted to.
